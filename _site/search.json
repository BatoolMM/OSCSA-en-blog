    "text": "I‚Äôm very excited to be officially starting my time as an Outreachy participant contributing to the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA). I‚Äôm Asma Kacem, a student from Tunisia that will graduate the next year.I pursue Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I love all types of sports, especially BasketBall.\n\nWhat is Outreachy?\n\n\n\n\n\nOutreachy is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technology industry where they are living. The goal of Outreachy is to increase diversity in open source.\nMy core values are Challenge, Responsibility, and Kindness.\n\nChallenge - Life without challenges will certainly feels duller I think. I face my challenges head on. There‚Äôs no time to waste in this life, and it‚Äôs either you pursue you challenges or the challenges will pursue you down to disappointment. I think the former is better option.\nResponsibility - Being responsible becomes an unavoidable thing as we all grow older. Taking ownership of your work and life is not easy but very important to live a good and fulfilling life.I have always felt that taking responsibility has helped me be more serious with my work and perform better.\nKindness - is something that is most needed in the world we live in today.Taking care and considering other people whenever we can not only help them but will also help us. I am still not good enough to say that kindness is my core value, but it is quite important for me. I would like it to be one of my core values some day in future, and till then, I will try to be more kind each day.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs a quote!\n\n‚ÄúSet a goal,you‚Äôve got one shot make it count‚Äù\n\nFor anyone who is considering, I highly recommend applying as well! It can be intimidating to make your first contributions to open source (I remember how nervous I was making my very first PR), but the community and my mentor helped me a lot. And to go out of your comfort zone for a small time and then a little more each time, it really is rewarding and you‚Äôll learn so much.\nThanks for reading. üí´‚ú®\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  title = {Hello {Open} {Source} {Enthusiasts!}},\n  date = {2022-05-30},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. ‚ÄúHello Open Source Enthusiasts!‚Äù May 30,\n2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/."

    "text": "Hello Everyone!\nWelcome to the second blog post for the Outreachy series! This blog‚Äôs topic is ‚ÄúEveryone Struggles‚Äù.\n\n\n\nstrug\n\n\nFor me, I am not facing any particular issues at this stage. Just sometimes I feel I still don‚Äôt know when to stop googling and ask the questions. But thanks to this opportunity, it teach me to ask for help from a more experienced person and my mentor when I‚Äôm stuck, it will save me a lot of time.\nEverything is going well, I‚Äôm learning very interesting new topics related to my field of study it was challenging but with the help and guidance of my mentor, everything become easy.\nThe bright side of all the struggle and hard work is that we learn and get out of our comfort zone. So the advice I can give is to believe in yourself. You‚Äôll learn new things and start gaining confidence gradually.\nTo conclude, all I can say is to develop the habit of asking for help when you are stuck. It will save you a lot of time. Also, do not be too hard on yourself. Make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get some rest when stressed. Sometimes maybe the reason you can‚Äôt figure things out is that you are tired or hungry. Lastly, never doubt yourself. If you can make it this far then you definitely can accomplish your project.\n\n\n\nstruggle\n\n\nThanks for reading. üí´‚ú®\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@misc{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  title = {Everyone {Struggles!}},\n  date = {2022-07-22},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. ‚ÄúEveryone Struggles!‚Äù July 22, 2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/."

    "text": "Richie Moluno\n\n\n\n\n\nI am Richie Moluno, a Fullstack developer but more of a backend developer. My major stack is MongoDb ExpressJS and NodeJs. Currently, I am studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Benin, Benin City. I originally wanted to study Robotics because of the Iron-man movie. I really love robots, the process of converting computer codes to mechanical movements really intrigues me. When it was time to move to the University, the school I had in mind didn‚Äôt have any courses in Robotics. Based on my knowledge then, I felt Mechanical Engineering would be the closest alternative to Robotics.\n\n\n\nMy Passion\nI really love to code, I think the passion doesn‚Äôt rely on coding itself. I‚Äôm more interested in anything that involves applying complex logic to get desired results. I often go for the more complex tasks because when I overcome these tasks, it gives me a greater sense of reward and achievement. While I am not coding, I like listening to Jordan Peterson; he speaks a lot on self-improvement, becoming a better person, being morally upright and how to live a meaningful life. I also like listening to music. I like the idea of reading books not often, though, but I am more interested in books that talk about human psychology. It helps me gain a better understanding of how the human mind works. I also like to play table tennis.\n\n\nWhy I Chose Outreachy and My Career Path\nBeing an Outreachy intern is a great opportunity for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in Open source, the opportunities here aren‚Äôt limited to open source alone; in my opinion, they cut across other areas in Tech. One thing I learnt is my learning process would‚Äôve been way shorter if I had good insight early enough. I had no mentor right from when I started coding; at first, I didn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôll be an issue, but I considered how long I spent going through unnecessary course content and learning concepts which weren‚Äôt needed for the career path I chose. I think having a mentor would really help in guiding and pointing me on the right path. I see Outreachy as a means to learn more from peers, gain solid experience in open source contributions as well as make new valuable connections. I hope to gain more experience in open source contributions, learn more about the open source community and also make new valuable connections that will be transferrable into the Robotics industry."

I will share about my experiences so far in the community and getting to learn new things (tools and skills). I am happy that I started the internship with an open mind to learn and that I was prepared to go through the hustle. Having to learn new skills or technology while taking on a task does not come easy, and sometimes one might spend more hours than intended.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example: I had a task to set up and write code documentation for a project. We discussed the importance of code documentation and its ripple effects for future reference. Code documentation is great for keeping track of what a codebase does. It enhances code readability, reproducibility, and usability. Up until then, I had only known about project documentation, and the closest thing to code documentation for me was to add a comment. I learned about three code documentation tools: Sphinx, Sphinxjs, and JSdocs. Sphinx is for Python projects, so I used JSdoc for the code documentation. Getting started with Jsdocs was simple, but I had some difficulties using it for React components and producing a readable documentation file. After a couple of hours of research, I believe I did better than I had started, and most importantly, I learned a great tool.\n\nFinally, but not least,\nWhen learning a new skill, the change from uncertainty to understanding is inevitable. And when things come together and start to connect and make sense, you realize that the struggles were worth it, yet this is only possible when you are willing to persist through the confusion and awkwardness."

Whether it‚Äôs personal struggles, professional struggles, or struggles in relationships, we all go through difficult times in our lives. But just because we all struggle, doesn‚Äôt mean that our struggles are the same. For some, their struggles may be as small as finding the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. For others, it may be as big as dealing with the loss of a loved one. Regardless of the size or scale of our struggles, one thing is for certain ‚Äì they are an inevitable part of the human experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a point in time, i struggled with learning new concepts, i had this fear of trying new things. I saw most concepts as too difficult to understand. With time i learnt that nothing is too big to achieve, no concept is too difficult to understand, it may seem difficult at first but its really simple, they just have a stack of linked foundational knowledge, you just need to find the basic knowledge necessary and build on it.\nIt‚Äôs important to remember that everyone struggles in their own way, and that our struggles do not define us as a person. They are simply a part of our journey, and they are there to teach us valuable lessons. Whether it‚Äôs learning to be more resilient, developing a stronger sense of self-awareness, or learning to be more compassionate, our struggles are an opportunity for growth."
