## What is Quarto?
Quarto is a new open source project that aims to make it easier for people to create and publish blog posts. It is a static site generator that uses the Markdown syntax to create blog posts. Quarto is written in the R programming language and is available for download on GitHub.

## Get started
### Prerequisites
To get started with contributing with Quarto, you will need;

- A GitHub account.
- A basic understanding of Markdown is recommended but not necessary.

### Setup Local environment
To start making contributions to the OSCA blog, you will need to setup a personal environment on your personal Github account. This will allow you to make changes to the blog without affecting the live version of the blog.

#

##### Step 1 - Fork the repository
To get started, you will need to fork the OSCA blog repository from GitHub.
![](./1_create_fork_new.png){fig-align="center" width="100%" }

#

##### Step 2 - Create a new branch
Next create a new branch for your blog post using the following command, the branch should be created on your forked repository.

- To create the new branch, navigate to your forked repository.
- Under the repository name, click on the drop down menu and select the `View all branches` option.

- Click the `New branch` button.

- Enter the name of your new branch and click the `Create branch` button.

### Create a new blog post
To create a blog post using Quarto, you would need to first create a Markdown file using the Quarto syntax. Markdown is a simple markup language that is often used to format text on the web. The Quarto syntax extends the basic Markdown syntax with additional features and functionality, such as the ability to add columns, tables, and other advanced formatting options.

For this tutorial, we won't be building a blog from scratch. Instead, we will be adding new posts to the OSCA blog using Quarto.

#

##### Step 1 - Create a new folder 
- Switch to the branch that you created in the previous step.

- Navigate to the `posts` folder and create a new folder with the name of your blog post. For example, if you are writing a blog post about *how to add a blog post using Quarto*, you can name your folder to `how-to-add-a-blog-post-using-quarto`.

![](./create_new_file.png){fig-align="center" width="80%" }

- Type the name of the folder followed by a forward slash `/`. This would create a subfolder in the `posts` folder. The folder name should be in lowercase and should not contain any spaces. Instead, use hyphens to separate words.

#

##### Step 2 - Create a new file
You'll need a new `index.md` file. This is where you will write your blog post using the Quarto syntax.

- Add the name of the file that you want to create. For example, if you want to create a file named `index.md`, type `index.md` 
![](./create_new_file2.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

- Press the `Commit new file` button to create the new folder and file.
![](./create_new_file3.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}


#

##### Step 3 - Add front matter
The index.md file should contain the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My first blog post using Quarto"
author: "Richie Moluno, Goodnews Sandygudie"
date: "2022-12-08"
categories: "blog"
description: "This is my first blog post for the OSCA blog using Quarto."
licence: "CC BY"
type: "post"
image: "./quarto.png"
citation: 
    url: https://oscsa.netlify.app/posts/my-first-blog-post/
---
```

The front matter is a set of metadata that is used to describe the blog post. It is written in YAML format and is enclosed in three dashes. The front matter contains the following fields.

-  `title`: The title of your blog post.
-  `author`: The name of the author of the blog post.
-  `date`: The date the blog post was published.
-  `categories`: The categories that the blog post belongs to.
-  `description`: A short description of the blog post.
-  `licence`: The licence that the blog post is published under.
-  `type`: The type of blog post. This can be either a post or a page.
-  `image`: The image that will be used as the featured image for the blog post.
-  `citation`: The citation for the blog post.

#

##### Step 4 - Write your blog post
After the front matter, you can start writing your blog post using the Quarto syntax. The Quarto syntax is a simple markup language that is often used to format text on the web. It extends the basic Markdown syntax with additional features and functionality, such as the ability to add columns, tables, and other advanced formatting options.

 For example, you can use # characters to create headings, - or * characters to create bullet points, and > characters to create block quotes.

Note: If you dont know how to write a blog post using the Quarto syntax, you can check out the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for more information.

If you dont want the blog post to be published immediately, you can add the following field to the front matter:

```yaml
draft: true
```

#

##### Step 5 - Add images
To add images to your blog post, add the image file to the same folder as the `index.md`. You can then reference the image in your blog post using the following syntax:

```markdown
![](./<image-name>.<image-extension>)
```

#

##### Step 6 - Commit your changes
Once you have finished writing your blog post, you can save the file and commit your changes to your forked repository.

#

##### Step 7 - Create a pull request
- Next, you will need to create a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch. You can do this by navigating to the GitHub repository and clicking on the `New pull request` button.

![](./new_PR_new.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

- The branch for the base repository should be set to `main` and the branch for the head repository should be set to the branch that you created in the previous step. Click the `Create pull request` button to create a new pull request.

![](./new_PR1.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

- You can then add a title and description for your pull request. Click the `Create pull request` button to create a new pull request.

![](./new_PR2.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

The title of your pull request should be a short description of the changes that you made.
it should follow the format `[blog]: Title of your blog`

Automatically, the PR template will be added to the description of your pull request. You can add more information about your pull request in the description.

#

##### Step 8 - Merge your changes
Once you have created a pull request, you can wait for your changes to be reviewed and merged to the main branch.

#

### Preview your blog post
Since we are working directly from the Github account and Quarto is a command line tool, you can not preview the HTML rendered version of your blogpost.
To see the preview:

- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the `/post` folder, then open the new folder you created.
- Open the terminal here and run `quarto preview`. This will open a new tab in your browser with the preview of your blog post.

This will start a local server that will host your blog post. You can then navigate to the URL that is displayed in your terminal to preview your blog post.

#

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to create a blog post using Quarto. We started by installing Quarto and setting up our local environment. We then created a new blog post using the Quarto syntax and previewed it using the Quarto serve command. Finally, we submitted a pull request for the new changes.
