### Create a new blog post
To create a blog post using Quarto, you would need to first create a Markdown file using the Quarto syntax. Markdown is a simple markup language that is often used to format text on the web. The Quarto syntax extends the basic Markdown syntax with additional features and functionality, such as the ability to add columns, tables, and other advanced formatting options.

For this tutorial, we won't be building a blog from scratch. Instead, we will be adding new posts to the OSCA blog using Quarto.

##### Step 1
Navigate to the `posts` folder and create a new folder with the name of your blog post. For example, if you are writing a blog post about how to add a blog post using Quarto, you can name your folder.`how-to-add-a-blog-post-using-quarto`.

##### Step2
Navigate to the new folder and create a new `index.md` file. This is where you will write your blog post using the Quarto syntax.

The Quarto syntax is a simple markup language that is often used to format text on the web. The Quarto syntax extends the basic Markdown syntax with additional features and functionality, such as the ability to add columns, tables, and other advanced formatting options.

##### Step 3
The index.md file should contain the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My first blog post using Quarto"
author: "Richie Moluno, Goodnews Sandygudie"
date: "2022-12-08"
categories: "blog"
description: "This is my first blog post for the OSCA blog using Quarto."
licence: "CC BY"
type: "post"
image: "./quarto.png"
citation: 
    url: https://oscsa.netlify.app/posts/my-first-blog-post/
---
```

The front matter is a set of metadata that is used to describe the blog post. It is written in YAML format and is enclosed in three dashes. The front matter contains the following fields.

-  `title`: The title of your blog post.
-  `author`: The name of the author of the blog post.
-  `date`: The date the blog post was published.
-  `categories`: The categories that the blog post belongs to.
-  `description`: A short description of the blog post.
-  `licence`: The licence that the blog post is published under.
-  `type`: The type of blog post. This can be either a post or a page.
-  `image`: The image that will be used as the featured image for the blog post.
-  `citation`: The citation for the blog post.

##### Step 4
After the front matter, you can start writing your blog post using the Quarto syntax. For example, you can use # characters to create headings, - or * characters to create bullet points, and > characters to create block quotes.

Note: If you dont know how to write a blog post using the Quarto syntax, you can check out the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for more information.
If you dont want the blog post to be published immediately, you can add the following field to the front matter:

```yaml
draft: true
```


##### Step 5
Once you have finished writing your blog post, you can save the file and commit your changes to your local repository. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my first blog post using Quarto"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

##### Step 6
Next, you will need to create a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch. You can do this by navigating to the GitHub repository and clicking on the `New pull request` button.

##### Step 7
Once you have created a pull request, you can wait for your changes to be reviewed and merged to the main branch.

#

### Preview your blog post
To preview your blog post, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
quarto serve
```

This will start a local server that will host your blog post. You can then navigate to the URL that is displayed in your terminal to preview your blog post.

#

### Publish your blog post
To publish your blog post, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will render your blog post and save it as an HTML file. You can then upload the HTML file to any platform that supports HTML files.

#

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to create a blog post using Quarto. We started by installing Quarto and setting up our local environment. We then created a new blog post using the Quarto syntax and previewed it using the Quarto serve command. Finally, we published our blog post using the Quarto render command.

In your file, you can use Quarto syntax to add formatting and structure to your blog post.
