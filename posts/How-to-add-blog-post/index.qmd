## What is Quarto?
Quarto is a new open source project that aims to make it easier for people to create and publish blog posts. It is a static site generator that uses the Markdown syntax to create blog posts. Quarto is written in the R programming language and is available for download on GitHub.

## Get started
### Install Quarto
To install quarto on your computer, you can download the latest version of R from the R Project website. Once you have installed R, you can install the quarto package using the following command: 
    
```r
install.packages("quarto")
```

Alternatively, you can install quarto from the command line using the following command:

```bash
Rscript -e "install.packages('quarto')"
```

or Download the latest version from the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) website.

After installing quarto, you can pick a preferred editor of your choice. Some popular editors include RStudio, Atom, and Visual Studio Code. You can also use any text editor or word processor that supports the Markdown syntax.

You can download the latest version of these editors here.

-  Vscode from the [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website.
-  RStudio from the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) website.
-  Atom from the [Atom](https://atom.io/) website.

### Setup Local environment
##### Step 1
To get started, you will need to fork and clone the OSCA blog repository from GitHub. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Science-Community-Saudi-Arabia/OSCSA-en-blog
```

##### Step 2
Next create a new branch for your blog post using the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```


### Create a new blog post
To create a blog post using Quarto, you would need to first create a Markdown file using the Quarto syntax. Markdown is a simple markup language that is often used to format text on the web. The Quarto syntax extends the basic Markdown syntax with additional features and functionality, such as the ability to add columns, tables, and other advanced formatting options.
For this tutorial, we won't be building a blog from scratch. Instead, we will be adding new posts to the OSCA blog using the Quarto syntax.

##### Step 1
Navigate to the `posts` folder and create a new folder with the name of your blog post. For example, if you are writing a blog post about how to add a blog post using Quarto, you can name your folder.`how-to-add-a-blog-post-using-quarto`.

##### Step2
Navigate to the new folder and create a new `index.md` file. This is where you will write your blog post using the Quarto syntax.

##### Step 3
The index.md file should contain the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My first blog post using Quarto"
author: "Richie Moluno, Goodnews Sandygudie"
date: "2022-12-08"
categories: "blog"
description: "This is my first blog post for the OSCA blog using Quarto."
licence: "CC BY"
type: "post"
image: "./quarto.png"
citation: 
    url: https://oscsa.netlify.app/posta/my-first-blog-post/
---
```

The front matter is a set of metadata that is used to describe the blog post. It is written in YAML format and is enclosed in three dashes. The front matter contains the following fields:

-  `title`: The title of your blog post.
-  `author`: The name of the author of the blog post.
-  `date`: The date the blog post was published.
-  `categories`: The categories that the blog post belongs to.
-  `description`: A short description of the blog post.
-  `licence`: The licence that the blog post is published under.
-  `type`: The type of blog post. This can be either a post or a page.
-  `image`: The image that will be used as the featured image for the blog post.
-  `citation`: The citation for the blog post.

To create a new Markdown file using Quarto, you can use any text editor or word processor that supports the Markdown syntax. In your file, you can use Quarto syntax to add formatting and structure to your blog post. For example, you can use # characters to create headings, - or * characters to create bullet points, and > characters to create block quotes.

Once you have created your Markdown file using Quarto syntax, you can save it with a .md file extension and use it to create a blog post on any platform that supports Markdown. Some popular platforms for publishing blog posts include WordPress, Blogger, and Tumblr. You can also use a static site generator, such as Jekyll or Hugo, to convert your Markdown file into a standalone HTML webpage that you can host on your own website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
