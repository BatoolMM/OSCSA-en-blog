 My name is Goodnews Sandy, I am a Frontend Developer and a Technical Writer. I enjoy building web-based applications that leave a lasting impressions on users using various frontend technologies.  I write to consolidate my knowledge and also share with others.  I love contributing to open source and my hobbies: sports and reading. 

Congratulations to me!! I have been selected to participate in the [Outreachy 2023 Internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) and I will be contributing to the [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://osc-ksa.com/). The Outreachy Internship is a three months program to contribute to any open source community of your choice. For the selection period, I contributed to improving the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) website and also colloborated in developing a Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) platform. The mentors were super helful and I enjoyed contributing to the community.

The Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) is a huge community in Open Science and I am excited about the things I will be learning during the internship period. I look forward to learning with the community and I intend to maximize all the opportunities available to me. I believe the knowledge from this experience would be an added value to my skill sets and career progression in general. 

Alright Let's do this!!!

## Richie Moluno
I am Richie Moluno, a Fullstack developer but more of backend development. My major stack is MongoDb ExpressJS and NodeJs. Currently I study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Benin, Benin City. I originally wanted to study because of the Iron-man movie. I really love robots, the process of converting computer codes to mechanical movements really intrigues me. When it was time to move into the University, the school i had in mind didn't have any course for robotics. So based on my knowledge then, i felt Mechanical Engineering would be the closest alternative to Robotics. 

### My passion
I really love to code, i think the passion doesn't rely lie on coding itself, i'm more interested in anything that involves applying complex logic to get desired results. I often go for the more complex tasks, because when i overcome these tasks it gives me a greater sense of reward and achievement. 
While i am not coding i like listening to Jordan Peterson, he speaks alot on self improvement, becoming a better person, being morally upright and how to live a meaningful life. I also like listening to music. I like the idea to read books not often though, but i am more interested in books that talk on human psychology it helps me gain a better understanding of how the human mind works. I also like to play table tennis

### Why i chose Outreachy and my career path
Being an Outreachy intern a great opportunity for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in Open source, the opportunities here aren't limited to open source alone, in my opinion it cuts across other areas in tech. One thing i learnt is, my learning process would've been way shorter if i had good insight early enough. 
I had no mentor right from when i started coding, at first i didn't feel like it'll be an issue, but i considered how long i spent going through uneccessary course content, learning concepts which weren't needed for the career path i chose. I think having a mentor would really help in guiding and point me in the right path. see outreachy as a means to learn more from peers, gain solid experience in open source contributions as well as make new valuable connections. 
I hope to gain more experience in open source contributions, learn more about the open source community and also make new valuable connections that will be transferrable into the Robotics industry. 

### My experience with open source


Here are a few more reasons why i want to become an MLH Fellow:

* I will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects and learn new technologies that are used in the industry.

* I will receive mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals who can help me to developi' my skills and grow as a professional.

* I will have the chance to network with other MLH Fellows and industry experts, which can help me build valuable connections and relationships within the tech community.

As an MLH Fellow, I'll gain access to a wide range of resources and support, including technical training, job search assistance, and career development advice.

By participating in the program, I also have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the tech industry, by contributing to important projects and helping to drive innovation and progress.

Overall, becoming an MLH Fellow will be a way to advance my career in technology and gain experience.
