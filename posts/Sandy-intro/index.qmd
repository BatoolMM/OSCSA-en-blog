 My name is Goodnews Sandy, I am a Frontend Developer and a Technical Writer. I enjoy building web-based applications that leave a lasting impressions on users using various frontend technologies.  I write to consolidate my knowledge and also share with others.  I love contributing to open source and my hobbies: sports and reading. 

Congratulations to me!! I have been selected to participate in the [Outreachy 2023 Internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) and I will be contributing to the [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://osc-ksa.com/). The Outreachy Internship is a three months program to contribute to any open source community of your choice. For the selection period, I contributed to improving the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) website and also colloborated in developing a Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) platform. The mentors were super helful and I enjoyed contributing to the community.

The Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) is a huge community in Open Science and I am excited about the things I will be learning during the internship period. I look forward to learning with the community and I intend to maximize all the opportunities available to me. I believe the knowledge from this experience would be an added value to my skill sets and career progression in general. 

Alright Let's do this!!!

## Richie Moluno
I am Richie Moluno, a Fullstack developer but more of backend development. My major stack is MongoDb ExpressJS and NodeJs. Currently I study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Benin, Benin City. I originally wanted to study because of the Iron-man movie. I really love robots, the process of converting computer codes to mechanical movements really intrigues me. When it was time to move into the University, the school i had in mind didn't have any course for robotics. So based on my knowledge then, i felt Mechanical Engineering would be the closest alternative to Robotics. 

### My passion
I really love to code, i think the passion doesn't rely lie on coding itself, i'm more interested in anything that involves applying complex logic to get desired results. I often go for the more complex tasks, because when i overcome these tasks it gives me a greater sense of reward and achievement. 
While i am not coding i like listening to Jordan Peterson, he speaks alot on self improvement, becoming a better person, being morally upright and how to live a meaningful life. I also like listening to music. I like the idea to read books not often though, but i am more interested in books that talk on human psychology it helps me gain a better understanding of how the human mind works. I also like to play table tennis
