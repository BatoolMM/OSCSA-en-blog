 My name is Goodnews Sandy, I am a Frontend Developer and a Technical Writer. I enjoy building web-based applications that leave a lasting impressions on users using various frontend technologies.  I write to consolidate my knowledge and also share with others.  I love contributing to open source and my hobbies: sports and reading. 

Congratulations to me!! I have been selected to participate in the [Outreachy 2023 Internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) and I will be contributing to the [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://osc-ksa.com/). The Outreachy Internship is a three months program to contribute to any open source community of your choice. For the selection period, I contributed to improving the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) website and also colloborated in developing a Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) platform. The mentors were super helful and I enjoyed contributing to the community.

The Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) is a huge community in Open Science and I am excited about the things I will be learning during the internship period. I look forward to learning with the community and I intend to maximize all the opportunities available to me. I believe the knowledge from this experience would be an added value to my skill sets and career progression in general. 

Alright Let's do this!!!
