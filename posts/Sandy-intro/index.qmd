## Goodnews Sandy
 Hi! My name is Goodnews Sandy, I am from Nigeria. Nigeria is a great country in Africa with beautiful landscapes and great weather throughout the year. Nigeria has many languages and varities of meal receipes. I hope you visit someday. 

### What I do
 I am a Frontend Developer and a Technical Writer. I enjoy using frontend technologies to build web-based applications that leave lasting impression on users.  I write to consolidate my knowledge and also share with others. I love contributing to open source because I get to learn new technologies and build tools that peolple can use.  My hobbies: sports and reading. 

 I have an educational background in Petroleum Engineering and had a career change to Computer Science related field because it offered me more opportunities to use my creativity to build things.  I love building things!!! and I hope to use my skills to contribute to the Oil and Gas sector.

### As an Outreachy Intern
I am one of the successful candidates selected to participate in the [Outreachy 2023 Internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) , I applied to Outreachy because I see it as an opportunity to learn new technologies and contribute to varities of community through Open Source.  The Outreachy Internship is a three months program to contribute to any Open Source community of your choice. For the selection period, I chose [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://github.com/Open-Science-Community-Saudi-Arabia) because their goals were clearly stated.  I contributed to improving the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) [website](https://github.com/Open-Science-Community-Saudi-Arabia/OSCSA_Website) and also colloborated in developing a [Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs)](https://github.com/Open-Science-Community-Saudi-Arabia/MOOCs/tree/dev_team2) platform. The mentors were super helful and I enjoyed contributing to the community.  

### Learning in [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)](https://osc-ksa.com/).
The Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) is part of a bigger Open Science Community. The Open Science Community is made up of scientists and researchers working together to build research tools, share knowledge and promote Open Science practices.
 
I am excited to be contributing to the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) for the Internship period. There is a lot to learn and I am prepared for it. We communicate with the mentors through Notion  and GitHub , and have two meetings per week to discuss progess. A couple of tasks has been listed on the notion board which includes: building blog post with [ Quarto](https://quarto.org/), intergating [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) to make  multilingual content, exploring [JupterBooks](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and  [Sphinx-js](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for documentation.

I look forward to learning with the community and I intend to maximize all the opportunities available to me. I believe the knowledge from this experience would be an added value to my skill sets and career progression in general. 

Alright Let's do this!!!

## Richie Moluno
I am Richie Moluno, a Fullstack developer but more of backend development. My major stack is MongoDb ExpressJS and NodeJs. Currently I study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Benin, Benin City. I originally wanted to study because of the Iron-man movie. I really love robots, the process of converting computer codes to mechanical movements really intrigues me. When it was time to move into the University, the school i had in mind didn't have any course for robotics. So based on my knowledge then, i felt Mechanical Engineering would be the closest alternative to Robotics. 

### My passion
I really love to code, i think the passion doesn't rely lie on coding itself, i'm more interested in anything that involves applying complex logic to get desired results. I often go for the more complex tasks, because when i overcome these tasks it gives me a greater sense of reward and achievement. 
While i am not coding i like listening to Jordan Peterson, he speaks alot on self improvement, becoming a better person, being morally upright and how to live a meaningful life. I also like listening to music. I like the idea to read books not often though, but i am more interested in books that talk on human psychology it helps me gain a better understanding of how the human mind works. I also like to play table tennis

### Why i chose Outreachy and my career path
Being an Outreachy intern a great opportunity for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in Open source, the opportunities here aren't limited to open source alone, in my opinion it cuts across other areas in tech. One thing i learnt is, my learning process would've been way shorter if i had good insight early enough. 
I had no mentor right from when i started coding, at first i didn't feel like it'll be an issue, but i considered how long i spent going through uneccessary course content, learning concepts which weren't needed for the career path i chose. I think having a mentor would really help in guiding and point me in the right path. see outreachy as a means to learn more from peers, gain solid experience in open source contributions as well as make new valuable connections. 
I hope to gain more experience in open source contributions, learn more about the open source community and also make new valuable connections that will be transferrable into the Robotics industry. 

### My experience with open source
