# Introduction
The process of learning involves struggles but it's good for you. Goodnews Sandy and Richie Moluno will be sharing perspectives on "Everyone Struggles".

My name is Goodnews Sandy, and I am currently contributing to the OSCSA community. I will share about my experiences so far in the community and getting to learn new things (tools and skills). I am happy that I started the internship with an open mind to learn and that I was prepared to go through the hustle. Having to learn new skills or technology while taking on a task does not come easy, and sometimes one might spend more hours than intended.

An example: I had a task to set up and write code documentation for a project. We discussed the importance of code documentation and its ripple effects for future reference. Code documentation is great for keeping track of what a codebase does. It enhances code readability, reproducibility, and usability. Up until then, I had only known about project documentation, and the closest thing to code documentation for me was to add a comment. 
I learned about three code documentation tools: Sphinx, Sphinxjs, and JSdocs. Sphinx is for Python projects, so I used JSdoc for the code documentation. Getting started with Jsdocs was simple, but I had some difficulties using it for React components and producing a readable documentation file. After a couple of hours of research, I believe I did better than I had started, and most importantly, I learned a great tool.

#### Finally, but not least,
When learning a new skill, the change from uncertainty to understanding is inevitable. And when things come together and start to connect and make sense, you realize that the struggles were worth it, yet this is only possible when you are willing to persist through the confusion and awkwardness.

Everybody struggles. It's a universal truth that nobody is immune to. Whether it's personal struggles, professional struggles, or struggles in relationships, we all go through difficult times in our lives. But just because we all struggle, doesn't mean that our struggles are the same.

For some, their struggles may be as small as finding the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. For others, it may be as big as dealing with the loss of a loved one. Regardless of the size or scale of our struggles, one thing is for certain â€“ they are an inevitable part of the human experience.

At a point in time, i struggled with learning new concepts, i had this fear of trying new things. I saw most concepts as too difficult to understand. With time i learnt that nothing is too big to achieve, no concept is too difficult to understand, it may seem difficult at first but its really simple, they just have a stack of linked foundational knowledge, you just need to find the basic knowledge necessary and build on it.

It's important to remember that everyone struggles in their own way, and that our struggles do not define us as a person. They are simply a part of our journey, and they are there to teach us valuable lessons. Whether it's learning to be more resilient, developing a stronger sense of self-awareness, or learning to be more compassionate, our struggles are an opportunity for growth.
